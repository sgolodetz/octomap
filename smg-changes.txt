1) QGLViewer needs to be built with QT Creator

2) Various fixes are needed for octovis itself:

octovis-shared:
* Link D:\Qt\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\lib\Qt5Core.lib
octovis:
* Define QT_NO_FLOAT16_OPERATORS
* Copy the Qt DLLs to the executable directory (otherwise the Anaconda ones are found instead)
* Add QT_PLUGIN_PATH=D:\Qt\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\plugins to the environment
